# App

This is a deployment wrapper for the whole thing. It
wraps run_async.py into a bash script "run" as was
required.

There is also a simple test script. 

"./run" requires bash enviroment

"test.py" as it is coded requires bash
and kiwi repiository - if you don't have it, go to 
../../kiwisources and do "git clone
https://github.com/kiwicom/travelling-salesman.git" or recode it 
to use some of the files that come w/ this repo e.g.
"../input/100_airports_input.csv"
